## Project Pink Aid: What is it?
Project Pink Aid is the name of the chatbot. The color pink repersents purity, love, and compassion; and the goal of this service to ensure aid is available and accessible for our Veterans.

## Why Project-Pink-Aid? 
The idea of Project Pink Aid came about after taking some time to think about how I can make a positive change in my community. Walking on the outside of my college campus, it is very noticable to me that many people around me suffer from homelessness. It also strikes me that many of the homeless people I walk by are Veterans of this country, and it saddens me to think about how they sacrificed their life, but are not able to have a roof over their heads. With Project Pink Aid the goal is to ensure an easy and accessible way of finding housing.
